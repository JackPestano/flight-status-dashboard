# flight-status-dashboard (Interactive Dashboard using Power BI)
We’ve been given access to a database containing nearly 2,000,000 commercial flights from major US airports, and the task is to use that data to understand which flights were delayed or canceled, and why.

## Project Objective
- Using Power BI, I transformed the raw data into a user-friendly, interactive dashboard to help stakeholders drill into flight delays and cancellations by airport, airline, day of week, and more.
